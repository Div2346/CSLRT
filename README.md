# CSLRT
Continuous Sign Language Recognition and Translation
An amalgamation of a cross-functional team of 4 members: Ansh Chourasia, Aniket Sharma, Kartik Saxena and Divyanshi Sharma, working together to create something useful to bridge the communication gap between the signers and non-signers.

Here's what we did!
• Accomplished feature extraction by converting INCLUDE50 dataset videos into frames and analyzing hand movements, facial
expressions, and body posture.
• Formulated a simplified translation architecture using knowledge distillation over BERT, enabling deployment on low-resource
devices and broadening accessibility.
• Streamlined information flow by preparing gloss and sentence data from ISLR and INCLUDE datasets, increasing system efficiency
by 88% through improved process integration and team collaboration
